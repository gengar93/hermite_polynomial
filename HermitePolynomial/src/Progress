MATRIX CLASS

This class has mostly everything required.

Input : a 2d array of doubles

Attributes
- the 2d array
- number of rows
- number of columns

Methods
- add(): two overloaded methods, one object method taking another matrix and a static method which takes two
- multiplyWithScalar(): takes a double and scales all elements by this number
- multiply(): two overloaded methods, one object method which takes another matrix and another which takes a polynomial (a column matrix)
- toString(): a proper way to print matrices has been implemented


POLYNOMIAL

This class has a few additions pending

Input: either a 1d array of doubles or a column matrix

Attributes:
- the degree of the polynomial
- a column matrix to hold coefficients

Methods
- toString(): a tuple representation of the polynomial

Possible improvements and additions
- trailing zeroes from the input should be removed.
- the degree is obtained from the length of the coefficient array. trailing zeroes are not ignored. this should be fixed.
- a method to add polynomials. care should be taken when their degrees differ since the underlying arrays holding coeff are different.
- a good method to print
